# Mod Overview
- Make command shortcuts using Weave.
# Usage
- Add the jar from the releases into your weave mod folder and load up your game.
- Run `/register <shortened-command> <command-to-run>`
- Because of my SHEER competency, it doesn't work if you are running a command with more than one argument. I could probably fix this later but I don't feel like it.
